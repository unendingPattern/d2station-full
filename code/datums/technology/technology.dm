Integrating Objects into the Science Research and Development System

First of all, the root /obj/ define has to have two variables added to it if it doesn't have them already:
	var/list/origin_tech = list()
	var/reliability = 100

* The origin_tech list is a list of all the technolgies (by ID) and their level at the time the object was created (format: "ID" = #).
If an object can't be reversed engineered, you're just going to leave this variable alone.
* The relability var is the reliability of an object before tech modifiers. Items that start spawned and items that aren't part of the
R&D system should just leave the reliability var at 100 and ignore it. Otherwise, you'll want to adjust it down based on the
pre-technology-modifier reliability you want for the object. You'd also want to add some sort of mechanic that deals with that
var as well.
*SPECIAL NOTE: For non-carriable objects that you can deconstruct into RE'able parts, make sure to include some way of passing on
the data from the components to the finished procuct and back again.
