	Maptext Demo/Library created by Albro1 on 12APRIL2012.

	This is more of a demo than a library, as it does not contain very much.  These may be helpful to some, however, so I am setting
		it up as a library for those who wish to use it.

	I did not do very much commenting in this, but I hope my explanation as well as the simplicity of this will overcome that.

	I give credit to Kaiochao for the text_obj.  This originated with his code, but I redid the New() proc to suit my needs, and added more things.

	The key thing here is, obviously, text_obj.  It's fairly simple.  Don't bother referencing it with a variable unless you need to, all you need is this:

	new /text_obj(text, place_at, show_to)

	This is another reason this is more of a demo than a library; it does a specific thing.  This "library" creates a label above atom X and shows it to mob Y.

	In all reality, unless you are using the text_obj for some other reason, you don't ever need to call it's new() proc yourself.
		Just call:
			place_at.maptext_CreateText(show_to)

		I hope that is labeled enough for you to understand what it does.

	You shouldn't have to worry about any clashing procs should you include this as a library.  I used the "maptext_" naming convention on all of these.
