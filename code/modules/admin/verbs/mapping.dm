//- Are all the floors with or without air, as they should be? (regular or airless)
//- Does the area have an APC?
//- Does the area have an Air Alarm?
//- Does the area have a Request Console?
//- Does the area have lights?
//- Does the area have a light switch?
//- Does the area have enough intercoms?
//- Does the area have enough security cameras? (Use the 'Camera Range Display' verb under Debug)
//- Is the area connected to the scrubbers air loop?
//- Is the area connected to the vent air loop? (vent pumps)
//- Is everything wired properly?
//- Does the area have a fire alarm and firedoors?
//- Do all pod doors work properly?
//- Are accesses set properly on doors, pod buttons, etc.
//- Are all items placed properly? (not below vents, scrubbers, tables)
//- Does the disposal system work properly from all the disposal units in this room and all the units, the pipes of which pass through this room?
//- Check for any misplaced or stacked piece of pipe (air and disposal)
//- Check for any misplaced or stacked piece of wire
//- Identify how hard it is to break into the area and where the weak points are
//- Check if the area has too much empty space. If so, make it smaller and replace the rest with maintenance tunnels.
