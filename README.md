# D2Station V4

## D2K5 Space Station 13 Codebase (based on rev4407)

Public source code for the popular (previously leaked) D2K5 Space Station 13 server D2Station, which operated from 2009 until 2013\. D2Station was a semi-serious roleplay server with hilarious controversial features (think hellMOO).

**Features:**

*   Full API system for XenForo, which allows you to use bdBank and Trophies as the banking and achievement system in-game. This also allowed server and character statistics to be stored on the website.
*   Currency and banking system with a fully simulated economy and inflation.
*   [Shop/market](https://github.com/unendingPattern/xenforo-mods) integration which allowed users to choose which currency to buy items with.
*   Advanced atmospheric airflow and pressure systems (thanks to Baystation 12 for the original code, thanks to Emyylii for the modifications).
*   Reagent atmospherics WIP.
*   Reagent temperatures, heating/cooling, hotplates, expiring food if not kept cold, improved cooking.
*   Early gibbed/goonstation style map and features.
*   Dismemberment and synthetic limbs (thanks Xerif).
*   Advanced weapons and weapon construction system (thanks Nori/ChairChair).
*   50+ new chemicals, foods and drinks.
*   Nicer looking UI and tweaks.
*   Added various new sound effects and changed sound effects for existing things. Also added more ambience.
*   Ability to respawn during extended rounds using in-game currency.
*   Text-to-speech while wearing spacesuit helmets (moonbase alpha style).
*   Ability to use cigarettes as a reagent container, allowing you to smoke any chemical.
*   Segways and other forms of transport.
*   Improved lighting system.
*   Improved virology and science/research.
*   Examining items/characters by clicking from a distance.
*   Large amount of new hairstyles and clothing items.
*   Ability to climb over certain objects.
*   Emotes/actions in character right-click menu
*   Improved health, atmos and power calculations.
*   Large amounts of optimizations to the master controller and code in general.
*   Improved reagent mixing system.
*   New scanner interfaces which display full body damage and information.
