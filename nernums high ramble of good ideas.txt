The ability to eat things that aren't food via a command.
You may get these items back by pooping.
(Item in hand, use "Attempt to eat item" command, run a check for if its edible or not, and if it edible, eat it like a reagent,
(if its not edible, hold still and try to choke it back.
(Only small and tiny items may be eaten this way for 'storage'
((bonus points for if radios still work when eaten
